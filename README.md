# The C Programming Language - Solutions for the 2nd Edition

This repo contains solutions for the exercises of each chapter in the K&R book. The aim is to open source my solutions as a helpful reference for future readers.

### About the book

**The C Programming Language** written by _Brian Kernighan_ and _Dennis Ritchie_ is an invaluable resource for learning the core concepts of programming in C. It is often referred to as the **K&R** book.

### Running the Solutions

The provided solutions are independent of any IDE. You can run the solutions individually using a C compiler of your choice.

###### Running and Debugging in VS Code

If you are using VS Code, you can use the [tasks.json](.vscode/tasks.json) and [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) to easily compile and execute each file. I also recommend using the [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) extension by Microsoft for IntelliSense, debugging and code browsing. To show the debug button in VS Code for each C file, you can enable the _C_Cpp: Debug Shortcut_ under _Settings_ > _Extensions_ > _C/C++_.

### Feedback

If you find any mistake or can think of a more optimized or cleaner solution, please let me know! I'd be happy to hear from you.
